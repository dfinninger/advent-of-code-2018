# Advent of Code 2018

Implementing in Python, which I'm pretty familiar with.

And trying my hand and Rust, which I haven't touched since before 1.0.

I'm going to stick to the stdlib for each.

## Running

### Python

- Python 3.7.0

`python3 ./$day.py`

### Rust

- rustc 1.29.0 (aa3ca1994 2018-09-11)
- cargo 1.29.0 (524a578d7 2018-08-05)

`cargo run` (runs all days)
